<h1>The Best Movies According to Ebru</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>My favourite love movie. Everything is simple but so intimant. I can explain whole movie
    in that sentence: "Simplicity is key to brillance."
</p>
<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>This is the one of the funniest movie on Earth I think. I love the head actor. But not relational
    to that movie is hilarious. So good to spending time and laughing till your organs hurt.
</p>
<h3>Devil's Advocate</h3>
<p>This movie effect me so much. It's because of the unusual senario I think. Very impressive.</p>
